In its interdisciplinary foundation it is, on one hand, a continuation and specialisation of three year study programmes in the fields of humanities, including the programmes in Slovene studies and Cultural history. On the other hand, it is also intended for the graduated students of computer sciences and information sciences as it focuses the students on the work within the field of digital humanities. Due to differences pertaining to the competences of enrolled students of three year undergraduate study programmes, the proposed programme is laid as a methodological reflection and is project oriented. It aims to upgrade the subject specific competences of undergraduate studies within the context of new information technologies and the changes the latter have produced in society and culture. On the horizontal level, the study programme is related to the masters studies in the fields of humanities and computer and information sciences (within the scope of elective subjects). \r\nWithin the wider context of modern university educational practice, Digital humanities is still in the process of early recognition, though as a field of research practice its impact on the humanities as a whole has undoubtedly been significant. The programme establishes a balance between the humanities and computer sciences, different as they are at the methodological level. It focuses on the fundamental changes in man\u2019s self-understanding, changes which occur with the use of telecommunications and computer-assisted data processing. To these two disciplinary emphases, a lower percentage of academic contents is added from the fields of visual communications. \r\nThe interdisciplinary study programme has been developed in cooperation with the School of Humanities, School of Engineering and Management and School of Arts. \r\nAccording to the undergraduate diploma competences of the students the programme is split into two parallel lines. In view of the interdisciplinary nature of the digital humanities domain, the two approaches are closely scrutinized and their points of contact are foregrounded. In the first year some courses are conducted for the two groups separately, later the courses bring all the students together.

Content: The importance of digital methods at excavations has multiplied exponentially over the last few years, which is why they are now widely used as a standard on a variety of research and rescue excavations. In this case, the focus is not only on single aspects, such as computer-aided design, but also on content such as geodata processing and management, image-based 3D modeling and data archiving. Therefore, the course deals with various digital methods and tries to provide an overview of the multiple possibilities of digital methods at archaeological excavations. Furthermore, all content is presented in a theoretical and practical discourse with the students: the theoretical basics as well as topics like proprietary and open source software applications for the visualization and management of archaeological stratigraphies, computer-aided design, 2D \/ 3D photogrammetry, geo-information systems, and data management are taken into consideration. Regarding the hardware, current (satellite-based) 3D surveying instruments and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, \u0022drones\u0022) are also being dealt with. Methods: In addition to lectures by the coordinator, guided practical exercises, homework (summaries on scientific articles, software tutorials) and brief oral presentations of the acquired skills in class are performed by the students individually as well as in small groups regularly.","country_id":9,"city_id":120,"institution_id":1466,"department":"Department of Evolutionary Anthropology","course_parent_type_id":2,"course_type_id":6,"language_id":3,"access_requirements":"Please refer to the adjacent curriculum.","start_date":"2017-10-03","duration":null,"course_duration_unit_id":null,"recurring":true,"info_url":"https:\/\/ufind.univie.ac.at\/","ects":3,"contact_mail":"dominik.hagmann@univie.ac.at","contact_name":"Dominik Hagmann","lon":16.358315,"lat":48.230261,"tadirah_objects":[{"id":1,"name":"Artifacts","description":""},{"id":3,"name":"Computers","description":""},{"id":5,"name":"DigitalHumanities","description":null},{"id":6,"name":"Data","description":null},{"id":7,"name":"File","description":null},{"id":8,"name":"Images","description":null},{"id":9,"name":"Images(3D)","description":null},{"id":10,"name":"Infrastructure","description":null},{"id":13,"name":"Link","description":null},{"id":16,"name":"Map","description":null},{"id":17,"name":"Metadata","description":null},{"id":18,"name":"Multimedia","description":null},{"id":19,"name":"Multimodal","description":null},{"id":20,"name":"NamedEntities","description":null},{"id":21,"name":"Persons","description":null},{"id":22,"name":"Projects","description":null},{"id":23,"name":"Research","description":null},{"id":24,"name":"ResearchProcess","description":null},{"id":27,"name":"Software","description":null},{"id":29,"name":"Standards","description":null},{"id":32,"name":"Tools","description":null},{"id":33,"name":"Video","description":null},{"id":34,"name":"Visualization","description":null}],"tadirah_techniques":[{"id":3,"name":"Browsing","description":null},{"id":9,"name":"Distance Measures","description":null},{"id":13,"name":"Gamification","description":null},{"id":14,"name":"Georeferencing ","description":null},{"id":15,"name":"Information Retrieval","description":null},{"id":16,"name":"Linked Open Data","description":null},{"id":18,"name":"Machine Learning","description":null},{"id":19,"name":"Mapping","description":null},{"id":22,"name":"Named Entity Recognition ","description":null},{"id":23,"name":"Open Archival Information Systems","description":null},{"id":24,"name":"Pattern Recognition","description":null},{"id":25,"name":"Photography","description":null},{"id":27,"name":"Preservation Metadata ","description":null},{"id":31,"name":"Scanning","description":null},{"id":32,"name":"Searching","description":null},{"id":37,"name":"Versioning","description":null}],"disciplines":[{"id":2,"name":"Archaeology"},{"id":4,"name":"Computer Science"},{"id":7,"name":"History"},{"id":19,"name":"Other"}],"course_duration_unit":null,"language":{"id":3,"name":"German"},"course_type":{"id":6,"course_parent_type_id":2,"name":"Course"},"course_parent_type":{"id":2,"name":"Credits"},"institution":{"id":1466,"city_id":120,"country_id":9,"name":"Universit\u00e4t Wien","description":"","url":"","created":"2016-12-09T12:03:13+00:00","updated":"2016-12-09T12:28:20+00:00"},"city":{"id":120,"country_id":9,"name":"Vienna"},"country":{"id":9,"name":"Austria"},"deletion_reason":null},{"id":414,"active":true,"deleted":false,"deletion_reason_id":null,"approved":true,"created":"2017-10-10T08:12:33+00:00","updated":"2019-05-27T14:32:27+00:00","name":"Digital Collection Management (low-residency certified program)","description":"The planning and performance of digitization projects and the realization of sustainable indexing and preservation concepts require qualified staff.

The main goal of the lecture series is definitely not to be exhaustive but rather to make the field familiar for students who have not been trained in an interdisciplinary field like this yet. Therefore the emphasis is laid on introducing students to some of the most important concepts and methods of digital humanities. Besides the basic theoretical background, the lectures shortly reflect on the technical processes and difficulties of digital research. The core part of the course includes the demonstration of several computational and quantitative methods, although without explaining the mathematical background in detail. The research questions and possible results of approaches labeled as distant reading and culturomics are placed in the center of discussion. The examples are chosen so that they facilitate students to raise questions contributing to the development of their own research topic in literary studies. The explained methods are also intended to give students an idea of project-based research and to make them able to work in collaboration with digital humanities specialists and computer experts of the field effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain topics and readings:\r\n\r\n1) The origins of modern media studies\r\nMcLuhan, Marshall. 1962.

Speaking with others through cables is not the same as meeting face to face, and playing music through screens and speakers is different from being in a real club setting. In the Music, Communication and Technology (MCT) Master\u0027s programme you will explore the possibilities (and limitations) of existing audiovisual communication, and will learn to develop new technologies, with a musical touch.\r\n\r\nThis is a different Master\u2019s programme. Music is at the core, but the scope is larger. You will be educated as a technological humanist, with technical, reflective and aesthetic skills.

Edition von Briefen und Manuskripten: Transkription, Annotation, Vernetzung am Beispiel der Sammlung \u201eDaniel Sanders\u201c","description":"Der Sprachforscher und Lexikograph Daniel Sanders (1819\u20131897) ist neben den Gebr\u00fcdern Grimm wohl der bedeutendste Lexikograph des 19. Jahrhunderts. Wie kein Zweiter stellt er in seinen zahlreichen lexikographischen Werken den aktuellen Sprachgebrauch des 19. Jahrhunderts umfangreich und in systematischer Weise dar. Seine bisher unver\u00f6ffentlichte Korrespondenz mit Gelehrten unterschiedlichster Fachrichtungen gew\u00e4hrt einen einzigartigen Einblick in die sprachwissenschaftlichen, philologischen, aber auch die politischen Themen jener Zeit.\r\nBasierend auf Sanders\u2019 Briefwechsel vermittelt das Seminar Grundlagen und weiterf\u00fchrende Kenntnisse zur Erstellung einer digitalen Edition. Der Schwerpunkt des Kurses liegt somit in der praktischen Anwendung von X-Technologien, um digitale Editionen zu planen und technisch zu realisieren. Neben einer allgemeinen Einf\u00fchrung in verschiedene Editionstypen und die daraus entstehenden Anforderungen einer digitalen Edition, z\u00e4hlt hierzu insbesondere die Codierung des Transkripts. Diese orientiert sich an den Richtlinien der internationalen Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), genauer am Basisformat des Deutschen Textarchivs, einem XML-basierten Standard zur Aufbereitung historischer Texte.\r\nGrundlegend daf\u00fcr ist die F\u00e4higkeit des Lesens der zeittypischen Kurrentschrift und deren Transkription, welche im Seminar exemplarisch vermittelt werden soll. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wird die Annotation der Manuskripte in TEI-XML einge\u00fcbt, Metadatenstandards wie das Correspondence Metadata Interchange Format vermittelt und der Webservice correspSearch vorgestellt. Neben der Ein\u00fcbung manueller Transkription wird auch die automatische Texterkennung handschriftlicher Dokumente (Hand-Written Text Recognition, HTR) unter Verwendung der Transkribus-Software vorgestellt. Die im Seminar entstehenden Transkriptionen und Metadaten der Dokumente werden anschlie\u00dfend im Deutschen Textarchiv ver\u00f6ffentlicht und erg\u00e4nzen die dort laufende Edition der Briefe und Dokumente Daniel Sanders\u2019.","country_id":3,"city_id":70,"institution_id":1511,"department":"Sprach- und literaturwissenschaftliche Fakult\u00e4t, Institut f\u00fcr deutsche Literatur","course_parent_type_id":1,"course_type_id":2,"language_id":3,"access_requirements":"","start_date":"2018-04-20","duration":null,"course_duration_unit_id":null,"recurring":false,"info_url":"https:\/\/agnes.hu-berlin.de\/lupo\/rds?state=verpublish\u0026status=init\u0026vmfile=no\u0026moduleCall=webInfo\u0026publishConfFile=webInfo\u0026publishSubDir=veranstaltung\u0026veranstaltung.veranstid=139750","ects":null,"contact_mail":"sebastian.goettel@bbaw.de","contact_name":"M.A. Sebastian G\u00f6ttel","lon":13.393632,"lat":52.518636,"tadirah_objects":[{"id":2,"name":"BibliographicListings","description":""},{"id":3,"name":"Computers","description":""},{"id":4,"name":"Curricula","description":""},{"id":5,"name":"DigitalHumanities","description":null},{"id":6,"name":"Data","description":null},{"id":7,"name":"File","description":null},{"id":8,"name":"Images","description":null},{"id":10,"name":"Infrastructure","description":null},{"id":11,"name":"Interaction","description":null},{"id":12,"name":"Language","description":null},{"id":13,"name":"Link","description":null},{"id":14,"name":"Literature","description":null},{"id":15,"name":"Manuscript","description":null},{"id":17,"name":"Metadata","description":null},{"id":20,"name":"NamedEntities","description":null},{"id":21,"name":"Persons","description":null},{"id":22,"name":"Projects","description":null},{"id":23,"name":"Research","description":null},{"id":24,"name":"ResearchProcess","description":null},{"id":27,"name":"Software","description":null},{"id":29,"name":"Standards","description":null},{"id":30,"name":"Text","description":null},{"id":31,"name":"TextBearingObjects","description":null},{"id":32,"name":"Tools","description":null},{"id":35,"name":"VREs","description":null}],"tadirah_techniques":[{"id":2,"name":"Brainstorming","description":null},{"id":3,"name":"Browsing","description":null},{"id":6,"name":"Commenting","description":null},{"id":7,"name":"Concordancing ","description":null},{"id":12,"name":"Encoding","description":null},{"id":14,"name":"Georeferencing ","description":null},{"id":26,"name":"POS-Tagging","description":null},{"id":27,"name":"Preservation Metadata ","description":null},{"id":31,"name":"Scanning","description":null},{"id":37,"name":"Versioning","description":null}],"disciplines":[{"id":1,"name":"Arts and Cultural Studies"},{"id":5,"name":"Ethnology"},{"id":7,"name":"History"},{"id":10,"name":"Library Science and Information Science"},{"id":11,"name":"Linguistics and Language Studies"},{"id":12,"name":"Literary and Philological Studies"},{"id":19,"name":"Other"}],"course_duration_unit":null,"language":{"id":3,"name":"German"},"course_type":{"id":2,"course_parent_type_id":1,"name":"Master Programme"},"course_parent_type":{"id":1,"name":"Degree"},"institution":{"id":1511,"city_id":70,"country_id":3,"name":"Humbold Universit\u00e4t Berlin","description":"","url":"","created":"2017-10-04T18:14:48+00:00","updated":"2017-10-04T18:15:54+00:00"},"city":{"id":70,"country_id":3,"name":"Berlin"},"country":{"id":3,"name":"Germany"},"deletion_reason":null},{"id":472,"active":true,"deleted":false,"deletion_reason_id":null,"approved":true,"created":"2018-06-08T04:43:10+00:00","updated":"2019-04-15T06:56:45+00:00","name":"Digital Humanities: Concepts and Approaches","description":"A review course on digital humanities for the students of all educational programs.

People from the humanities are often the most vulnerable to the technocentric trap. Insecurity sometimes makes a technical object loom too large in their thinking. Particularly in the case of computers, their intimidation and limited technical understanding often blind them to the fact that what they see as a property of \u0022the computer\u0022 is often a cultural construct. (http:\/\/www.papert.org\/articles\/ComputerCriticismVsTechnocentric.html)\r\n\r\nThis course aims to give an introduction to computational thinking in order to allow students to gain a basic understanding of the methodological foundations of computing; this is motivated by two complementary goals:\r\n\r\n1. to enable students to describe, interpret, and discuss the workings of computer-based systems and services-and thus be able to critically evaluate them with respect to the aspects studied by humanities and social sciences. The course aims to give students the basics necessary to engage, for example, in critical algorithm studies.\r\n2. to enable students to apply computational thinking to their own fields of studies in humanities or social sciences, so that they can make use of computational approaches in their studies and their research.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we will read and discuss scholarly texts (research papers, book chapters) as well as representations of computing in general media, but also engage in the practical construction of computational models in small groups using the Inform 7 system (http:\/\/inform7.com).","country_id":14,"city_id":55,"institution_id":50,"department":"Department of Language and Information Sciences","course_parent_type_id":2,"course_type_id":6,"language_id":4,"access_requirements":"","start_date":"2018-03-19","duration":null,"course_duration_unit_id":null,"recurring":true,"info_url":"https:\/\/applicationspub.unil.ch\/interpub\/noauth\/php\/Ud\/ficheCours.php?v_enstyid=64493\u0026v_blocid=\u0026v_ueid=174\u0026v_etapeid1=29023\u0026v_langue=fr\u0026v_isinterne=1","ects":3,"contact_mail":"michael.piotrowski@unil.ch","contact_name":"Michael Piotrowski","lon":6.584238,"lat":46.523792,"tadirah_objects":[{"id":5,"name":"DigitalHumanities","description":null},{"id":24,"name":"ResearchProcess","description":null}],"tadirah_techniques":[{"id":2,"name":"Brainstorming","description":null}],"disciplines":[{"id":18,"name":"Theory and Methodology of DH"}],"course_duration_unit":null,"language":{"id":4,"name":"French"},"course_type":{"id":6,"course_parent_type_id":2,"name":"Course"},"course_parent_type":{"id":2,"name":"Credits"},"institution":{"id":50,"city_id":55,"country_id":14,"name":"Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne","description":null,"url":null,"created":null,"updated":null},"city":{"id":55,"country_id":14,"name":"Lausanne"},"country":{"id":14,"name":"Switzerland"},"deletion_reason":null},{"id":486,"active":true,"deleted":false,"deletion_reason_id":null,"approved":true,"created":"2018-06-28T07:46:53+00:00","updated":"2019-07-02T13:53:22+00:00","name":"Les humanit\u00e9s num\u00e9riques \u2013 origines, d\u00e9finitions, d\u00e9veloppements","description":"Objective\r\n\r\nThe objectives for this course are located on two levels, (i) on the disciplinary level, specifically in digital humanities, and (ii) on the level of general scholarly competences, in particular in the use and peruse of scholarly publications.

We will work with many kinds of texts: looking at manuscript images, plain text documents, and structured documents like poems, novels, voyage logs, and plays, and learn how to transform and remix them in ways we can share on the public web and study with computer tools that we design for ourselves, based on the questions we ask. We work with computers in this course as precision instruments that help us to read and process great quantities of information, and that lead us to make significant connections, ask new kinds of questions, and design web resources for people curious about human history, culture, and creativity.\r\n\r\nOur class is one of the core courses of Pitt-Greensburg\u2019s Digital Studies Certificate, and it satisifes a range of general education requirements in quantitative reasoning, behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively interdisciplinary in engaging formal and quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists. Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your precision in writing and thinking. We will do all of this with an eye to your understanding how coding works in an openly collaborative environment, with an emphasis on building sustainable and freely accessible resources on the public web.\r\n\r\nStudents who complete this course will gain skills in digital project management and web development, and their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests. Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will not require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course, your documenting of problems when your coding doesn\u2019t yield the results you want. Homework exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors, and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.\r\n\r\nSurvey of Coding Technologies Covered:\r\nWe will be working primarily with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is a powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and questions. XML represents a standard in adaptability and human-readability in digital code, and it works together with related technologies with which you will gain working experience: You\u2019ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for transforming XML into many publishable forms. You\u2019ll learn to write XSLT: a programming \u201cstylesheet\u201d transforming language designed to convert XML to publishable formats, as well as to extract information and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn how to design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects organized and prevent errors. You\u2019ll gain experience with an international XML language called TEI (after the Text Encoding Initiative) which serves as the international standard for coding digital archives of cultural materials. Since one of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web, you\u2019ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to your website with JavaScript.\r\n\r\nLearning Objectives:\r\nWork with Texts as Artifacts\u2014As Physical and Virtual Objects:\r\n* Generate \u0022digital surrogates\u0022: digitally represent facsimiles of rare manuscripts and other kinds of documents, and make their content digitally searchable.\r\n* Reflect and write on the issues and problems with digital representation, as well as the capacity of the digital medium to enhance or add dimensions to a physical text.\r\n* Learn and practice coding in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and related coding technologies: to \u201cmark up,\u201d process, and extract information about the structure, physical condition, and cultural contexts of textual artifacts.\r\n\r\nGain Experience with Information Retrieval, \u201cDistant Reading,\u201d and Autotagging Techniques:\r\n* Write code to apply searching and data extraction methods through multiple kinds of pattern-matching algorithms, including forms of regular expression matching. Take conventional boolean searches and library database searches to new levels.\r\n* Apply \u201cmining\u0022 and \u0022drilling\u201d methods associated with \u0022distant reading\u0022 to apply computers to read and design more and differently than we could do \u201cmanually\u201d or with unassisted eyes and brains.\r\n* Learn how to \u201cautotag\u201d enormous texts or collections of texts, for practical results: to code the structure of enormous texts from a distance, in order to navigate them and make them accessible through distant reading.\r\n* Reflect on and test the strong and weak points of \u201cdistant reading\u201d and processing methods: (What do we learn, and what is at stake in current applications of digital \u0022distant reading\u0022?)\r\n\r\n Gain Project Design and Editing Experience:\r\n* Gain digital editing experience with proposing, designing, and contributing to a digital research project\r\n* Gain experience with collaborating and sharing code using a version control system (GitHub) in a team repository\r\n* Transform XML code into publishable web formats, to build or contribute to a project website.\r\n* Design navigation elements, and build visual aids and models (such as timelines and tree diagrams) from texts: to generate charts and images from extracted data\r\n* Gain experience with plotting digital graphs and charts\r\nLast but not least: Discover that you read and write with \u201cnew eyes,\u201d with greater precision and agility, thanks to your adventures in working with digital texts!","country_id":118,"city_id":185,"institution_id":1550,"department":"Humanities Division","course_parent_type_id":1,"course_type_id":1,"language_id":2,"access_requirements":"* cross-platform

Well, now\u0027s your chance!\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) lies at the crossroads of \r\nlinguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence. This\r\nMasters Program offers\r\na modern curriculum which combines the different \r\napproaches, and  covers both theoretical and applied perspectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each semester, the program includes a hands-on project. \r\nIt ends with a 6-month paid internship in a company or a research \r\nlab. You can find the course description below.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can apply to directly enter at either the first year or second year level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAll courses are taught in English\r\n(except the \u0022French for non-native Speakers\u0022 class).\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe University of Lorraine is publicly funded and thus offers \r\ntuition-free education for all students including students from \r\nboth inside and outside EU\/EEA\/EFTA countries. The only student \r\nexpenditures are a nominal semester fee of about 600 euros which \r\nincludes health insurance. Nancy\u2019s high quality of life goes \r\nhand-in-hand with a low cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhy Nancy?\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\nNancy is a center of excellence for NLP. It can boast of:\r\n\r\n\r\n1\/Two important research units:\r\n\r\n\r\n- LORIA, the computer science research laboratory http:\/\/www.loria.fr\/en\/\r\n\r\n\r\n- ATILF the linguistic research laboratory lab http:\/\/www.atilf.fr\/\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth research units participate in many national and \r\ninternational research projects. Their members are highly \r\nvisible in the international community and regularly publish \r\nin the most prestigious conferences and journals of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\/ Two Erasmus Mundus Masters

NLP?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Language Processing is a rapidly expanding field.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the proliferation of digital data, there is a massive need \r\nfor well-trained engineers and researchers able to exploit this \r\ndata for commercial (for example: e-commerce, recommendation \r\nsystems and translation) and socio-political (for example: \r\ne-learning, opinion mining, and behavioural predictions) purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nStart-ups, small firms with strong R\u0026D profiles and large companies \r\n(in France this includes Airbus, Thales, EDF, and Orange) are \r\nlooking for scientists and engineers who can contribute to the \r\ndevelopment of systems capable of managing and exploiting textual \r\ndata.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft) also recruit \r\nintensively in both the NLP and the Speech processing domain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a strong need for Ph.D. candidates in the field, as \r\nis demonstrated by the many Ph.D. proposals in both the public and \r\nthe industrial domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIn

in Digital Art History\/Computational Media","description":"The Department of Art, Art History and Visual Studies offers two types of degrees under the rubric of Digital Art History and Computational Media. The program builds on courses and well-developed strengths at Duke University, and requires ten (10) courses over three or four semesters in addition to summer research.  Students affiliate with an existing faculty research initiative, from which they will develop their own independent research project for the MA thesis, which combines written and digital project-based components.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Digital Art History track engages digital technologies in the research and presentation of art historical questions.  Common themes that can be explored are visualizing process, representing change over time, contextualizing displaced objects, and creating biographies of objects or databases\/collections of materials. The ideal candidate for the Digital Art History track seeks to engage digital tools in historical questions about works of art, buildings and cities.  The MA provides a springboard for advanced study in art history, archaeology, architectural history, and visual or media studies.  It also prepares students for future work in fields such as museums education and exhibition design, cultural heritage and preservation, public history, city planning, and architectural design. For more information see http:\/\/dukewired.org\/ma\r\n\r\n\r\nFunding may be available in the second and third semesters contingent on excellent work in the first semester of study.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Computational Media track emphasizes the study of visualization technologies in the context of media and technology histories, cultural analytics, and new media forms of expression.  Computational Media topics include the manufacture and dissemination of humanities data and its expression, the social and ethical considerations of digital cultural heritage interventions, and the aesthetic and rhetorical value of computational media forms.  The ideal candidate for the Computational Media track seeks deeper understanding of the intersection of quantitative and qualitative modes of historical and cultural research, is actively engaged with hands-on computational media production, and is interested in productive cross-overs between arts and sciences communities. This MA track prepares students for further graduate study in digital humanities and computational media and for training for jobs in media, design, advertising, and technical industries, among others.  For more information see http:\/\/sites.duke.edu\/computationalmedia\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MA program encourages applicants from across the Humanities and Social Sciences whether from established disciplines, such as history, archaeology, and art history, or emerging fields of study, such as spatial history, media arts \u0026 sciences, technocultural studies, or cultural geography.

Referring to their journey as the \u201cGrand Tour,\u201d travelers pursued intellectual passions, promoted careers, and satisfied wanderlust. They wrote letters, published literary accounts of their journeys, sought visual depictions of the sites they visited, while also collecting ancient remains to fill museums and private houses. What can digital approaches tell us about who traveled, where and why? How can we transform innovative scholarship on eighteenth-century literary, visual and material culture of travel into original digital methods for the study of the past? We will read, discuss, and interpret travel accounts and collections, and experiment with parsing, curation and visualization of historical data. Final projects will form credited contributions to the Grand Tour Project, a cutting-edge digital humanities platform (see https:\/\/ grandtour.stanford.edu).

The workshop will include presentations on the necessity and challenges of preserving web content (which disappears rapidly and must be preserved as a resource), of the underlying technologies in web content and its preservation, and on how archived web content may differ from the online originals. The presentations will also include small demonstrations and hands-on exercises. Technologies for archiving online content for research purposes will be presented and tried in a hands-on session in the last part of the workshop. For the hands-on session, participants will be able to work with methods relevant to their own specific projects. \u2013 Aim: A general understanding of archived web as a resource for research, as well as the underlying technologies for web content and its preservation. Hands-on experience with technologies that can be used for data gathering for their projects. \u2013 Target group: The workshop is open to all PhD students at any stage. Other researchers are also welcome. \u2013 Application deadline: Please apply for a spot via info@netlab.dk no later than four weeks before the workshop date.

Students can tailor their studies to suit their interests by choosing from a wide range of compulsory elective subjects relating to ongoing research projects. A project module prepares students to carry out their own independent research in various occupational fields. \r\n\r\nThe combination of a thorough grounding in computer science together with modules in applied digital humanities ensure that students acquire both theoretical and practical skills, as well as an ability to take a critical approach and communicate their ideas effectively.\r\n","country_id":3,"city_id":17,"institution_id":17,"department":"Department of Media Studies and Art History \/ Department Computer Science","course_parent_type_id":1,"course_type_id":2,"language_id":3,"access_requirements":"In order to be admitted to the Master\u0027s degree programme in Digital Humanities, students must have completed a subject-specific or subject-related undergraduate degree.\r\nA subject-specific degree is a Bachelor\u0027s degree in either Digital Humanities and Social Sciences, in Digital Humanities, or in Digital Social Sciences.

dialogue systems, question answering, information extraction and web search systems are fast becoming an integrated part of our digital devices and daily lives. They are a key component in artificial intelligence-based solutions that provide people with natural ways to communicate with machines (e.g. Siri or Alexa), other people (e.g. machine translation in Skype), information repositories and much more.\r\nThese technologies require a mix of skills and approaches from computer science, linguistics, statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, logic... If you are a computer specialist, an engineer or a mathematician, you may be wondering about the basic computing tools working behind these devices or how you can integrate these applications within other applications or the web. If you are a philologist or linguist, you probably wonder how linguistic knowledge is used in them: lexicon, grammar and word-senses; morphological, syntactic and semantic analyses...

Also in the humanities, researchers have been using computing power for several years to conduct \u0022experiments\u0022 with digital or digitized materials. Texts and images, which are evaluated in quantitatively large quantities for the purpose of new interpretations, remain a starting point. In contrast to scientific data, the evaluation of these \u0022data\u0022 is far less canonized. Analysis models and theories (such as stylometry or distance reading) are constantly discarded and propagated anew. In addition, linking, visualization and representations are possible that demand evaluations and new narratives.\r\n\r\nThe exercise introduces the digital humanities and is intended to practice one\u0027s own handling of digital materials, while at the same time criticizing and contextualizing the media implementation and evaluation of the data. No previous informatics knowledge is required, but the openness to play with data, text and image stocks.","country_id":14,"city_id":57,"institution_id":52,"department":"Walter Benjamin Kolleg, Digital Humanities","course_parent_type_id":2,"course_type_id":6,"language_id":3,"access_requirements":"","start_date":"2020-02-18","duration":1,"course_duration_unit_id":4,"recurring":false,"info_url":"https:\/\/www.dh.unibe.ch\/studium\/lehrveranstaltungen\/index_ger.html#collapse_pane792173","ects":3,"contact_mail":"tobias.hodel@wbkolleg.unibe.ch","contact_name":"Tobias Hodel","lon":7.45,"lat":46.95,"tadirah_objects":[{"id":2,"name":"BibliographicListings","description":""},{"id":5,"name":"DigitalHumanities","description":null},{"id":10,"name":"Infrastructure","description":null},{"id":20,"name":"NamedEntities","description":null}],"tadirah_techniques":[{"id":5,"name":"Collocation Analysis ","description":null},{"id":22,"name":"Named Entity Recognition ","description":null},{"id":36,"name":"Topic Modeling","description":null},{"id":41,"name":"Text Mining","description":null}],"disciplines":[{"id":1,"name":"Arts and Cultural Studies"}],"course_duration_unit":{"id":4,"name":"semester"},"language":{"id":3,"name":"German"},"course_type":{"id":6,"course_parent_type_id":2,"name":"Course"},"course_parent_type":{"id":2,"name":"Credits"},"institution":{"id":52,"city_id":57,"country_id":14,"name":"Universit\u00e4t Bern","description":null,"url":null,"created":null,"updated":null},"city":{"id":57,"country_id":14,"name":"Bern"},"country":{"id":14,"name":"Switzerland"},"deletion_reason":null},{"id":602,"active":true,"deleted":false,"deletion_reason_id":null,"approved":true,"created":"2020-02-07T20:34:12+00:00","updated":"2020-02-07T20:34:12+00:00","name":"Digital Scholarship and Skills Workshop Series","description":"The module comprises a suite of workshops to support the development of the critical understanding and practical skills needed to make best use of digital research tools in the context of humanities research.
